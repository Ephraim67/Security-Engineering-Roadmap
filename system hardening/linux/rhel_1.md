### **Overview**

RHEL system roles are a set of **Ansible roles** developed by Red Hat that allow you to **automate and standardize system administration tasks** across multiple RHEL systemsâ€”even across different major versions (e.g., RHEL 7 through 10). This ensures consistency, scalability, and efficiency in managing large environments.



### **Key Concepts in the Ansible Environment**

These are foundational elements you need to understand when working with RHEL system roles:

* **Control Node**
  The system from which Ansible playbooks are run. It can be:

  * A RHEL system (version 7 to 10)
  * Red Hat Satellite
  * Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform

* **Managed Node**
  These are the remote systems (hosts) that you want to configure and manage. Ansible doesn't need to be installed on them.

* **Ansible Playbook**
  A YAML file defining the **desired configuration** or steps for managed nodes to execute.

* **Inventory**
  A file listing all the managed nodes, often with IP addresses, and optional grouping for better organization. Also referred to as a `hostfile`.



### **Roles Available in RHEL System Roles Package**

Each role encapsulates automation for a specific system function. On a RHEL 10 control node, you get roles for:

| Role Name            | Function                                       |
