## Automating System Administration with RHEL System Roles

This project demonstrates how to automate consistent and repeatable configuration of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 10 deployments using **RHEL System Roles** and the **Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform**.

RHEL System Roles are a collection of pre-defined Ansible roles, modules, and playbooks developed by Red Hat to simplify system administration tasks across multiple hosts. This automation approach enables centralized, scalable management of RHEL systems using playbooks run from a single control node.
