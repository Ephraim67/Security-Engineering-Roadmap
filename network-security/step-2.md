## **What Theyâ€™re Trying to Achieve**

The client wants to **remotely deploy a digital in-room experience** for hotel guests that:

1. **Welcomes guests by name on TV or smart displays**
2. Shows **hotel services**, promotions, menus, etc.
3. Integrates with the **Property Management System (PMS)** (e.g., Opera, Maestro) to automate guest data and room information.
4. Provides **entertainment options** (IPTV, streaming, etc.)
5. Ensures hotel staff can **support and manage** the system without you after deployment.

Think of it as transforming a standard TV into a smart concierge and entertainment hub for each hotel room.
